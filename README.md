# Accident-detection
OVERVIEW:
This project presents an automated accident detection system leveraging deep learning and computer vision to enhance road safety by identifying accidents in real-time through CCTV footage.
Utilizing the YOLO (You Only Look Once) model for object detection, along with OpenCV and the Roboflow framework, the system detects potential collisions, analyzes impact severity, and identifies if immediate medical attention is necessary based on motion analysis and pose estimation of individuals involved. 
When an accident is detected, an automated alert is sent to emergency services, including real-time data about location, severity, and any visible injuries, enabling faster response times and improving the chances of saving lives.
This project showcases the integration of deep learning with smart city infrastructure, supporting efforts to reduce fatalities on roads and build safer urban environments.
